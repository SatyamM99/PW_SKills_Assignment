        "\n",
        "Missing Values: For boosting, use internal handling. XGBoost and CatBoost automatically learn the best direction for missing values during splitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Categorical Features: Use CatBoost to handle them natively via its internal target encoding, or use One-Hot Encoding for low-cardinality and Target Encoding for high-cardinality features if using XGBoost.\n",

        "\n",
        "Decision: CatBoost is the best choice here.\n",

        "**3. Hyperparameter Tuning Strategy**\n",
        "\n",
        "Method: Use Bayesian Optimization (e.g., Optuna) instead of GridSearch for faster convergence in high-dimensional spaces.\n",

        "Primary Metric: Precision-Recall AUC (PR-AUC).\n",

        "**5. Business Benefits**\n",
        "\n",
        "Reduced Loss: Accurately identifying high-risk applicants directly lowers the Default Rate.\n",

        "Automation: Speeds up the loan approval process, improving the customer experience.\n",
        "\n",
